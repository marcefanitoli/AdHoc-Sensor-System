# AdHoc-Sensor-System
ESP8266 MicroPython based wireless system

This project seeks to explore the use of wireless microchips in home analysis. It starts with the use of the esp8266 with micropython as micro servers. Later a server setup will be used to compile and analyze the data.


IoT Endpoint Device - device with sensor or actuator that listens for RESTful requests
Server - device which queries IoT endpoints, stores and plots the data. Potentially offering it as a website.
